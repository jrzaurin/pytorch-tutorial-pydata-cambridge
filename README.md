# Intro to Pytorch via Wide and Deep Models

Requirements are:

```
pandas
scikit-learn
jupyterlab
torch
tqdm
```

if you wanted to run the code in the notebooks, I would suggest  to clone the
repo and create an environment with your preferred method. E.g.:

```bash
mkvirtualenv pydata -p python3
git clone https://github.com/jrzaurin/pytorch-tutorial-pydata-cambridge
cd pytorch-tutorial-pydata-cambridge
pip install -r requirements
bash download.sh
```

and you are ready to go!
